# Submission Language Plugin for OJS 3.3

Display the manuscript language declared by the author upon creating a new submission for a multi-language journal. This plugin works only on the editorial dashboard for users with Manager-level roles.

Use the checkbox in plugin settings to select, whether the language information should be displayed as an ISO language code, or country flag (may not work correctly in some cases).
